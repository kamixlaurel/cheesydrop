# Project Proposal Title

## Project Concept

### Statement of the Problem
Here you give an introduction to the problem you're trying to solve. Don't be tempted to discuss your proposed solution here.

### Proposed Solution
This is the right section where you discuss your proposed solution to the problem. It can either be a first of its kind or an improvement to an existing solution.

Also, you can opt to list the main features of your proposed solution here, discussing them briefly.

### Target Users
This is where you state the users of your app. You can enumerate them if you're targetting several groups, along with a description that corresponds to their usage of the solution.

### Benefits
This is where you discuss the benefits of your solution. You basically have to justify the advantages of your solution over the problem itself.

*Note that benefits doesn't always have to be just for the target users. (ex. if you're creating an API for your application, it could also benefit other developers as well even if they're not your target)*
