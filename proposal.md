# Project Proposal Title
Cheesy Drop (Interactive School Bus Routing System)

## Project Concept
A school bus support system that suggests the best route in picking up their students and helps them manage their attendance. 

### Statement of the Problem
1. Unoptimized bus route due to missed pickups or delays 
2. Undertermined location of the student's designated bus

### Proposed Solution
The app will provide the following solution:
1. Shows the status of the student if they're still preparing or ready to go.
2. Real time tracking of the school bus along with the driver and bus information.

### Target Users
This is where you state the users of your app. You can enumerate them if you're targetting several groups, along with a description that corresponds to their usage of the solution.

### Benefits
This is where you discuss the benefits of your solution. You basically have to justify the advantages of your solution over the problem itself.

*Note that benefits doesn't always have to be just for the target users. (ex. if you're creating an API for your application, it could also benefit other developers as well even if they're not your target)*
