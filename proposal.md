# Project Proposal Title
Cheesy Drop (Interactive School Service Routing System)

## Project Concept
A school service system that allows the designated drivers to take track of the best possible route in picking up listed students as well as providing a parent-driver interaction through messaging, reminders and notification alerts.

### Statement of the Problem
Will answer questions such as:
1. Unoptimized school service route due to missed pickups or delays 
2. Undetermined location of the student's designated school service

### Proposed Solution
The app will provide the following solution:
1. Shows the status of the student if they're still preparing, ready to go or not attending.
2. Real time tracking of the school service location along with the driver and service information.

### Target Users
The target users of this application are school service drivers (or companies) and parents of the listed students.

### Benefits
  1. The school service route optimization reduces turnaround time.
  2. The systematize approach provides accurate drop-off time of the students.
  3. The tracking features ensures safety of the students. 
  4. The app gives convenience to the drivers and parents in terms of interaction.

*Note that benefits doesn't always have to be just for the target users. (ex. if you're creating an API for your application, it could also benefit other developers as well even if they're not your target) - Sir*
*Note for Jobea and Averos: Di ko muna dinilete yung note ni sir about sa API. If meron/wala, pa delete nalang po nitong note ko and nung note ni sir. - Kami*
